# Unbeatable Playing 11 Data Analysis Project for T20 World Cup 2022

Welcome to the Unbeatable Playing 11 Data Analysis Project for the T20 World Cup 2023! In this project, we've employed advanced data analysis techniques to determine the best playing 11 lineup for the tournament using Power BI. Our analysis is based on real-time data collected from ESPN Cricinfo and processed using cutting-edge tools and methodologies.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into several key phases:

### 1. Data Collection

We kick-started our project by collecting comprehensive data from ESPN Cricinfo using web scraping techniques. The data was obtained through an online tool called BrightData, ensuring accurate and up-to-date statistics.

### 2. Data Processing

The collected data was initially in JSON format, which we meticulously transformed into cleaned and structured CSV files. This transformation laid the foundation for our subsequent analysis.

### 3. Parameters Criteria

To construct our unbeatable playing 11 lineup, we defined specific parameters for each player category:
- **Openers:** Players with a high strike rate and consistent performance at the top of the order.
- **Anchors / Middle Orders:** Players who stabilize the innings and provide a strong foundation.
- **Finisher / Lower Order Anchor:** Batsmen known for finishing matches and handling pressure.
- **All-Rounders / Lower Order:** Players who excel in both batting and bowling, adding versatility to the team.
- **Specialist Fast Bowlers:** Bowlers with the ability to take wickets and control the game's pace.

### 4. Data Cleansing and Parameter Generation

We utilized the Power BI editor to refine and clean the data further. This step included generating new relevant parameters from the existing dataset, enabling us to evaluate players effectively.

### 5. Dashboard Design and Ideation

With a comprehensive dataset in hand, we brainstormed and designed an intuitive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard showcases our analysis, insights, and the final playing 11 lineup based on the parameters we defined.

### 6. Insightful Power BI Dashboard

Our final Power BI dashboard presents a visually engaging and insightful overview of the T20 World Cup 2023. It highlights the selected playing 11 lineup and provides deep insights into player performance, strengths, and areas of expertise.
